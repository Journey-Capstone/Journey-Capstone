<h2>A Message From Our Creators</h2>
<p>Reading has always been a passion of ours.  Not just to improve brain power, but also to exercise our imagination.  We see new books as new journeys, and we allow our imaginations to take us there.  Sometimes it's nice to re-take a journey that we once enjoyed, so some of us choose to read a book a second and third time.</p>
